# OpenWarp

OpenWarp is a 100% open-source Warp-style terminal that runs as a standalone desktop app and as a CLI. It defaults to zero telemetry and supports BYOM (bring your own model) for AI features.

## Workspace Setup
Run `cargo check` in the repo root to verify all Rust crates.

## CLI Usage
Install with `cargo install --path crates/openwarp-cli` and run `openwarp --provider ollama --model llama3`.
